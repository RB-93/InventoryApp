# InventoryApp_Stage_2

## Project name: Book Store

## Description:

This project was created as a part of the Android Basics Nanodegree and for Google India Scholarship Challenge 2k18. The goal of this project is to design and create the structure of an Inventory App which would allow a store to keep track of its inventory.
* In this project, I have worked on Book Store Inventory, allows user to track sales and shipments of books and make it easy for the user to order more from the listed supplier.

## Focus:

* In this project, I have build out the app UI and added functionality for users to add and remove inventory in the app made earlier in [Inventory_App_Stage_1](https://www.github.com/RB-93/InventoryApp_Stage_1.git).
